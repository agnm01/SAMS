1. Introduction 
I chose to implement a newsletter type of website which would show different news from domain such as art, math and science and publish them. My idea with this project was to build a website where I can post new things I learned or found
that influenced me in any way and share them with others. I would find different articles, stories etc. and take them through my own train of thoughts and publish them using my words and perspective. 
2. Inspiration 
In creating this website, I was majorly inspired by 3 things: my love for STEM education, the dynamic constant change of scientifical information and the wide range of subjects that can be approached in domains such as art, programming, math, science, medicine etc. 
3. Accessibility 
Web accessibility means that different websites and web technologies are designed and developed so that everyone can use them, regardless of their physical disabilities. 
   - The information on the site is presented in a concise, simple way to facilitate accessibility of people with mental disabilities. - The navigation buttons are easy to use, located at the top of the page, defined by either meaningful text such as "Home", "Author" etc. or suggestive icons (for the social networks for example). 
   - The website is responsive and can be used by any user, possessing any device and still be rendered in a comfortable way. 
4. Usability 
   - Usability in my website is represented by responsiveness for example. Therefore, each user can enjoy the website on any device equally. 
   - The color pallette and images used are simple, rendered properly for their dimensions, in a responsive way. That way, their scale remains the same and doesn't impact the user's experience negatively. 
   - Also, the fonts I used are general fonts, easy to read even if they are italicized or cursive. This increases accessibility as well. 
In the end, it's important to design and develop a web environment in which the user feels safe and finds pleasure in navigating through a website so that later, he may come back. 
5. Learning 
   - I had to learn about contact forms. In the 'Contact' page of my website I created a contact form where the user could, if a backend interface was implemented, send a message to the editing team at SAMS. The form details are: name(mandatory),
   email(mandatory), phone(not mandatory), message(mandatory) and 2 buttons, one to reset the form and one to submit the form. 
   - I had to learn about pagination in JavaScript in order to place all the articles I created on different pages and enable blog-like
    navigation. I did this using different tutorials on YouTube for the syntax, of course, after laying down my logic on a piece of paper. 
   - Another thing I had to learn about was proper responsive editing which took a while to figure out. My final goal regarding
    the website's responsiveness was to be used on as many different devices as possible, providing a satisfactory user experience regardless. 
6. Evaluation I 
I believe many of my website's aspects are successfully implemented. Some of these would be the responsive navbar, the styled author's page, the pagination for all articles etc. In particular, I enjoyed learning about the pagination and modals for forms so that I may implement them successfully. 
7. Evaluation II 
Next time, I would like to take more time to properly style the website so that it uses entirely the same color pallette, like a web template.
